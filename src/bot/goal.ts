/**
 * `/goal` — keep running rounds until the goal is actually closed.
 *
 * A headless `claude -p` / `codex exec` run is one-shot: when the turn ends the
 * process is gone, and anything it promised to do "afterwards" never happens.
 * A detached `nohup` job survives, but it can only *notify* — it cannot think,
 * check the result, or decide what to do next.
 *
 * This closes that gap on the bridge side: when a round ends, the bridge asks
 * the agent whether the goal is closed. If not, it starts another round on the
 * same session, so the agent picks up with full context. The work spans as many
 * runs as it needs while staying one continuous conversation.
 *
 * The signalling protocol is deliberately opt-out rather than opt-in:
 * **silence ends the loop**. The agent has to actively write a reason to keep
 * going, so a confused, crashed, or interrupted agent stops — the failure mode
 * costs one "继续" from the user instead of an unbounded run of API calls.
