# lark-channel-bridge

A lightweight bot that bridges Feishu / Lark messenger with your local Claude Code or Codex CLI. Run one command, scan a QR code to bind a PersonalAgent app, and talk to your local coding agent from chat.

[中文 README](./README.zh.md)

For a product walkthrough, see the [Feishu document](https://larkcommunity.feishu.cn/docx/OaRIdFIRFoLM3xxTmKwcetHqn5e).

## What it does

- Forwards Feishu / Lark messages to local Claude Code or Codex CLI. Send a DM directly, or `@bot` in a group.
- **Streaming card**: text replies and tool calls update on one Lark card in real time.
- **COT process messages**: optionally send a process message with agent progress text and tool calls, then send the final answer separately.
- **Session continuity**: each chat, topic, or document comment thread keeps its own session.
- **Queueing and batching**: messages sent in quick succession are handled together; messages sent during a run are queued for the next turn, while commands like `/new`, `/cd`, `/ws use`, and `/stop` can interrupt the current task.
- **Multiple workspaces**: use `/cd` to switch the current project, and `/ws` to save and reuse common project directories.
- **Images and files**: send them to the bot directly, and the bridge downloads them locally for the agent.
- **Interactive cards**: `/help`, `/ws list`, and `/status` return cards with clickable buttons.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js **>= 20.12.0**
- At least one local agent installed and logged in:
  - Claude Code: `claude`, see https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart
  - Codex CLI: `codex`, see https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli
- A Feishu / Lark **PersonalAgent** app. The first-run QR wizard can create and bind one for you.

## Install

```bash
npm i -g lark-channel-bridge
# or
pnpm add -g lark-channel-bridge
```

## First run

```bash
lark-channel-bridge run
```

The first run opens a QR-code wizard:

1. A QR code renders in your terminal.
2. Scan it with the Feishu / Lark app.
3. Pick or create a PersonalAgent app.
4. If prompted, choose which agent to initialize.
5. Config is written to `~/.lark-channel/config.json`.

You do not need to choose a project directory up front. The bridge creates a profile-managed default working directory; after startup, send `/cd <path>` in Feishu / Lark to switch to a real project.

If you already have a PersonalAgent app, pass `--app-id` during initialization to skip app creation. The command prompts for the App Secret.

```bash
lark-channel-bridge run --app-id cli_xxx
# or initialize and start the background service directly
lark-channel-bridge start --app-id cli_xxx
```

For Lark global apps, add `--tenant lark`.

## Background service

Use `run` for first-run setup and foreground debugging. After the bot can send and receive messages, stop the foreground process with `Ctrl-C`, then use an OS-managed service for background operation:

```bash
lark-channel-bridge start
lark-channel-bridge status
lark-channel-bridge stop
```

Install globally before using service commands. The daemon's launchd plist / systemd unit / Windows task records the bridge CLI path; if that path comes from an npm temp cache through `npx`, the daemon can break when the cache is cleaned. `run` is fine through `npx` as a one-shot foreground process.

Service commands install a per-profile service:

```bash
lark-channel-bridge start [--profile <name>]
lark-channel-bridge stop [--profile <name>]
lark-channel-bridge restart [--profile <name>]
lark-channel-bridge status [--profile <name>]
lark-channel-bridge unregister [--profile <name>]
```

Platform mapping:
- **macOS**: launchd user agent `ai.lark-channel-bridge.bot.<profile>`
- **Linux**: systemd user unit `lark-channel-bridge.bot.<profile>.service`
- **Windows**: Task Scheduler task `LarkChannelBridge.Bot.<profile>`, launched through a `.cmd` wrapper

Daemon logs are under `~/.lark-channel/profiles/<profile>/logs/daemon/`.

### Multiple profiles: Claude and Codex

By default, the bridge starts with the currently selected profile. Use `profile use <name>` to change it. Each profile keeps its own app credentials, sessions, working directories, and logs. Create multiple profiles only when you need to connect multiple PersonalAgent apps, or run Claude and Codex as separate bots:

```bash
lark-channel-bridge start --profile claude --agent claude
lark-channel-bridge start --profile codex --agent codex
```

For example, to restart only the Codex bot:

```bash
lark-channel-bridge restart --profile codex
lark-channel-bridge status --profile codex
```

## Commands

### Host CLI

```text
lark-channel-bridge run [--profile <name>] [--agent claude|codex] [--workspace <path>] [-c <config>]
lark-channel-bridge migrate [--profile <name>] [--agent claude|codex]
lark-channel-bridge ps
lark-channel-bridge kill <id|#>
lark-channel-bridge --help
```

`profile use <name>` changes the profile used by later default starts. Use these profile management commands when running separate Claude / Codex bots, connecting multiple PersonalAgent apps, or doing scripted deployment:

```bash
lark-channel-bridge profile create claude --agent claude
lark-channel-bridge profile create codex --agent codex
lark-channel-bridge profile list
lark-channel-bridge profile use <name>
lark-channel-bridge profile remove <name>
lark-channel-bridge profile remove <name> --purge --yes
lark-channel-bridge profile export <name> [--output ./profile.json] [--force]
lark-channel-bridge profile export <name> --include-secrets --yes
```

`profile remove` archives local state by default, including the active profile. If other profiles remain, the bridge switches to the next one; if it was the last profile, the root config is cleared so the same name can be created again. `--purge --yes` permanently deletes local state. `profile export` redacts app secrets by default; `--include-secrets --yes` includes sensitive config.

If a profile was created with the wrong agent kind, stop or unregister any matching background service first, then run `profile remove <name>` and recreate it with the intended `--agent`.

### Slash commands inside Feishu / Lark

| `/cd <path>` | Switch working directory and reset the session |
| `/ws list` | List named workspaces |
| `/ws save <name>` | Save the current working directory as a named workspace |
| `/ws use <name>` | Switch to a named workspace |
| `/ws remove <name>` | Delete a named workspace |
| `/resume` | Resume compatible history for the same agent, working directory, and permission mode |

DMs do not require an @ mention. Groups and topic groups require `@bot` by default; `@all` is ignored. Cloud-doc comments in supported document types run when the bot is mentioned.

## Goal mode (`/goal`)

A headless `claude -p` / `codex exec` run is one-shot. When the turn ends the process is gone, so anything the agent promised to do "afterwards" never happens — and a job it detached with `nohup` survives only to *notify*, never to check the result and decide what to do next. Work that genuinely needs several rounds has nowhere to live.

`/goal <goal>` closes that. After each round the bridge asks whether the goal is closed; if not, it starts another round on the same session, so the agent resumes with its full context. The work spans as many runs as it needs while staying one conversation.

```
/goal 部署新二进制并跑出第一个基线数字
```

Each round replies as usual, with `🔁 3/20` on the footer so a round-three progress report is not mistaken for an answer to whatever was asked last. Anything you send mid-goal is folded into the next round rather than waiting for the whole thing to finish, so you can steer without stopping it.

**Signalling is opt-out: silence ends it.** Each round gets its own signal file, and the agent must write the next step into it to earn another round. An agent that crashes, is interrupted, or simply forgets therefore *stops* — the cost of that failure is one "继续" from you, rather than an unattended run of API calls. A round's file is per-round, so a leftover one can never trigger a later round.

It stops on any of:

- the agent leaving the signal file unwritten (the goal is closed)
- `goalMaxRounds` rounds, default 20
- `goalMaxHours` elapsed, default 8
- three rounds in a row giving the identical reason — restating a blocker is not progress
- `/stop` or `/goal off`

Every ending posts why, and whether the goal was actually reached. A bridge restart kills the in-flight run, so the goal is parked rather than resumed silently: the chat gets a notice and `/goal resume` picks it back up from the round it reached.

## Background callbacks (后台回执)

`/goal` covers work the agent does itself, round after round. The other shape is a job that **outlives** the run: a build, an upload, a batch that takes twenty minutes. `nohup` keeps it alive, but the agent that started it is gone, and until now the only way that job could speak was to send a Feishu message — which, with the profile's `lark-cli` resolving to user identity, went out *as the user*.

Every run's `bridge_context` now carries a `wakePrefix` path. A detached job writes one line under it:

```bash
nohup bash -c '
  <the real command> > /tmp/job.log 2>&1
  rc=$?
  f=$(mktemp "<bridge_context.wakePrefix>.XXXXXX")
  printf %s "done (exit=$rc); log at /tmp/job.log" > "$f"
  mv "$f" "$f.wake"
' >/dev/null 2>&1 &
```

The bridge sweeps for `*.wake` every 2s and does two things: posts the line into the chat **as the bot**, and hands it to the agent as a fresh turn on the same session. So the agent comes back with full context and finishes the job. `mktemp` + `mv` is not decoration — a fixed filename loses one of two concurrent reports, and writing `.wake` in place can be swept half-written.

The prefix names the run that handed it out, so a report threads back to *its own* message and is attributed to whoever started it — a colleague using the same group meanwhile does not end up owning someone else's job. It is derived rather than allocated, so it survives restarts, and it is the same mechanism in a DM, a group, and a topic — no @-mention involved.

Delivery is at-least-once: a report is removed only after it has been handed off, so a crash or a restart mid-delivery replays it rather than swallowing it. One written while the bridge was down is delivered on the next start (up to a day later). If the chat post itself fails, the agent is told so and puts the content in its own reply instead of acknowledging something nobody saw. A scope accepts 30 wakes an hour; past that the chat gets one throttle notice and the rest are dropped.

Under a Codex `workspace-write` sandbox the inbox is passed as `--add-dir`, so a job can write it from outside the workspace. Under `read-only` nothing can be written at all, and the channel is unavailable along with everything else.

## Steering a run in flight

A run used to be sealed the moment it started: a message sent while the agent was working waited in the queue until the run ended, then started a fresh one. Say "wait, the other file" thirty seconds into a five-minute task and the agent finished the wrong task first.

Now a message that arrives mid-run is **handed to the running turn** (Claude Code profiles). The agent sees it at its next step — between two tool calls, typically within seconds — and adjusts, in the same run and the same context. On the reply it appears quoted at the point it was taken in, `💬` in front, so the transcript reads in order:

```
正在读取 config.ts…
> 💬 [张林 (user)]: 等等，是 config.prod.ts
好，换成 config.prod.ts。
```

Nothing about this is a new turn: the agent is told as much, and the footer, the goal round, the session are all still the run's own. Several messages inside one quiet window go in together, each tagged with its sender, since a mid-run message may well be someone else's.

**What still waits for the next run**, in the order it arrived: anything carrying an attachment or a card (those need the full prompt path), the task a `/goal` command generates (it has to start its own driver), and anything sent after one of those — order across messages is kept even at the cost of a steer. Codex profiles cannot be steered at all (`codex exec` is one-shot) and keep the old serial behaviour throughout. There is a cap of 20 hand-overs per run and 4000 characters per hand-over; past either, messages simply wait.

**Delivery is confirmed, not assumed.** The CLI replays each message at the moment it takes it in, and that replay is the bridge's receipt. A message the run ended without incorporating — the agent finished too fast, the process died, the pipe broke — is not lost: it is re-delivered as the next run, in its original position. `/stop` drops what was waiting, exactly as it always dropped the queue; what had already reached the agent stays with it.

One thing steering deliberately does **not** do is reset the watchdogs. Your message reaching the agent proves nothing about the agent, so a stall warning already on screen stays there, and a run that was wedged is stopped on the same schedule whether or not you kept talking to it.

## Receipt reaction (收到)

Every message the bridge takes on gets a reaction the moment it is accepted — a 📌 pushpin by default. That covers the message that starts a run, but the point is the other two: a message queued behind a run, and a follow-up handed to a run in flight. Neither shows anything else until the agent gets to it, and a follow-up sitting there for a minute otherwise looks exactly like one that never arrived. The mark is what tells them apart.

The mark is honest in the other direction too: if the bridge lets a message go without handling it — `/stop` or another queue-dropping command drops it, or the run it was waiting for cannot start — the reaction is taken back. A mark that stays means the message reached the agent, or still will. Commands are not marked; their reply is the receipt.

Pick the sticker, or turn it off, under **收到回执** in `/config`, or set `preferences.ackReaction` in `config.json` to any Feishu reaction `emoji_type` (`"Pin"`, `"Get"`, `"OK"`, `"THUMBSUP"`, …) or `false`. The receipt is put on at intake, before any agent is involved, so Claude and Codex profiles get it alike.

## Reply Display and COT

`/config` controls three presentation settings:

- **Message reply mode**: `message card` streams the final reply; `plain text` sends once after the run finishes.
- **Tool-call display**: controls whether tool blocks appear in the final card / markdown reply.
- **COT process message**: `off` sends only the final reply; `brief` first sends a COT message with agent progress text and tool summaries; `detailed` also includes tool args and truncated output.

When COT is enabled, the bridge splits the process view and final answer into two messages. The COT message is for tracing what the agent did; the final answer is still generated from the agent's raw text, without heuristic bridge-side filtering. If an agent emits final-answer text as ordinary stream text, that text can also appear in the COT process message.

## lark-cli identity policy

Each profile uses a profile-local lark-cli directory at `~/.lark-channel/profiles/<profile>/lark-cli`. The agent process receives `LARKSUITE_CLI_CONFIG_DIR` for that directory, so personal authorization in one profile is not shared with another profile.

The default policy is `bot-only`: lark-cli uses the app/bot identity and does not access personal resources. When a user authorizes personal resources such as calendar, mail, or drive, the current profile can switch to `user-default`, which keeps app identity available and also allows the authorized user identity. Owner/admin users can inspect or change this policy in `/config`; `/status` shows the current summary as `lark-cli: app` or `lark-cli: user-ready`.

## Working directories

Each profile may define a default working directory through `workspaces.default`. New profiles may be created with `--workspace <path>`; if omitted, the bridge creates a profile-managed default working directory.

This is a profile-field snippet. Do not replace the whole `config.json` with it; edit the matching profile's `workspaces` field.

```json
{
  "workspaces": {
    "default": "/Users/me/.lark-channel-workspaces/claude/default"
  }
}
```

The bridge checks that a selected directory exists, is a directory, and is not an overly broad location such as `/`, the home root, a system directory, or a temp root. The working directory is only the current directory for an agent run. It is not a filesystem sandbox; actual file access still depends on the local agent process and its permission mode.

## Permission modes

The recommended user-facing profile config is `permissions.defaultAccess` and `permissions.maxAccess`. New profiles default to `full` for both values so the bridge can keep local tools, authorization flows, file writes, and other agent features fully usable. To tighten a profile, set one or both values to `workspace` or `read-only`; stricter modes can limit local tool execution, login/authorization flows, file writes, and similar capabilities.

This is a profile-field snippet. Do not replace the whole `config.json` with it; edit the matching profile's `permissions` field.

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "defaultAccess": "full",
    "maxAccess": "full"
  }
}
```

Mode mapping:

| Bridge access | Claude permission mode | Codex mode |
|---|---|---|
| `full` | `bypassPermissions` | `danger-full-access` |
| `workspace` | `acceptEdits` | `workspace-write` |
| `read-only` | `plan` | `read-only` |

The legacy `sandbox` field is still readable for old configs. After the bridge saves the profile, it migrates that setting to canonical `permissions`.

## Data directories

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `~/.lark-channel/config.json` | Root config with profiles and active profile |
| `~/.lark-channel/active-profile` | Last selected profile |
| `~/.lark-channel/profiles/<profile>/sessions.json` | Session state |
| `~/.lark-channel/profiles/<profile>/sessions.json.catalog.json` | Agent-aware session catalog |
| `~/.lark-channel/profiles/<profile>/workspaces.json` | Current and named workspace bindings |
| `~/.lark-channel/profiles/<profile>/secrets.enc` | Profile-local encrypted secrets |
| `~/.lark-channel/profiles/<profile>/lark-cli/` | Profile-local lark-cli directory |
| `~/.lark-channel/profiles/<profile>/media/` | Attachment cache |
| `~/.lark-channel/profiles/<profile>/logs/` | Structured run logs |
| `~/.lark-channel/registry/processes.json` | Local process registry |
| `~/.lark-channel/registry/locks/` | Profile and app locks |

Set `LARK_CHANNEL_HOME=/path/to/state` to move all local bridge state. `LARK_CHANNEL_LOG_DAYS` overrides log retention.

## Access control

**Chat access is private by default: out of the box, only *you* can use the bot in DMs and groups.** "You" = whoever created / owns the Feishu app (the person who scanned the QR to set it up). The bot figures out who the app owner is automatically from Feishu, so **solo chat use needs zero configuration** — you can DM it and `@`-mention it in any group, and everyone else's chat messages are silently ignored (no "permission denied" reply, which would only confirm the bot exists). Cloud-doc comments are document-scoped; see below.

To let other people or groups in, add them to one of three lists:

| List | Controls | Add | Remove |
|------|----------|-----|--------|
| **Allowed users** | who can DM the bot | `/invite user @them` | `/remove user @them` |
| **Allowed chats** | which groups the bot answers in (for **everyone** in them) | `/invite group` (current group) / `/invite all group` (every group the bot is in) | `/remove group` (current group) |
| **Admins** | who can change settings, and use the bot in any group | `/invite admin @them` | `/remove admin @them` |

> `/invite` and `/remove` can only be run by **you (the creator) and admins**. The `@` in the command points at the *target person* (not the bot) — the bot resolves the mention to their identity, so you never deal with raw IDs.

### Two identities that bypass everything

- **You (the creator)**: subject to no list at all — DMs, any group, every command. You **can never lock yourself out**: even if the lists get messed up, DM the bot and send `/config` to get back in. Transfer the app's ownership in the Feishu console and the bot follows the new owner automatically.
- **Admins**: can DM, run management commands like `/config`, and **bypass the allowed-chats list** — the bot answers them in any group, listed or not. Good for teammates who co-maintain the bot.

### Common setups

- **Just me** → nothing to do; this is the default.
- **Let a teammate DM the bot** → `/invite user @them`
- **Open a work group to everyone in it** → send `/invite group` inside that group
- **First-time setup, onboard every group the bot is already in** → `/invite all group` pulls them all into the list at once; trim with `/remove group` afterwards
- **Add a co-admin** → `/invite admin @them`

### Worth knowing

- Changes take effect on the **next message** — no restart needed.
- **In groups you must `@` the bot first** (DMs don't need it). That's a separate toggle (`/config` → "require @ in groups"), independent of the lists above.
- Strangers get pure silence — no reply at all. The one exception: if someone `@`-mentions the bot in a group that hasn't been opened up, the bot posts a friendly one-liner telling them an admin can run `/invite group` to enable it.
- Cloud-doc comments are document-scoped: anyone who can comment in a supported document and mention the bot can trigger a reply.

### Advanced: editing the config file directly

If you'd rather not do it inside Feishu, `/invite` and `/config` write the matching profile's `access` field in `~/.lark-channel/config.json`. Empty lists mean nobody from that list, not open access. This is a profile-field snippet; do not replace the whole `config.json` with it:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "profiles": {
    "claude": {
      "agentKind": "claude",
      "access": {
        "allowedUsers": ["ou_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"],
        "allowedChats": ["oc_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"],
        "admins": ["ou_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"],
        "requireMentionInGroup": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`allowedUsers` / `admins` take user `open_id`s; `allowedChats` takes group `chat_id`s. The easiest way to find an ID by hand: have the person message the bot (or `@` it in the group), then check the active profile's log:

```bash
grep '"event":"enter"' ~/.lark-channel/profiles/<profile>/logs/bridge-$(date +%Y%m%d).jsonl | tail -5
```

Each line carries `chatId` (group / DM id) and `senderId` (user `open_id`). After a manual edit, **restart the bridge** or send `/reconnect` from an allowed admin context to apply it. For day-to-day tweaks `/invite` / `/config` are easier; direct edits are mainly for deployment scripts that pre-seed access.

## Cloud-doc comments

Cloud-doc comments do not need a separate workspace binding or document allowlist. In supported document comments, mention the bot and the bridge replies in the same thread. Comment runs reuse the document session key and fall back to the user home directory when no document cwd was previously recorded.

## FAQ

**The bot stays silent or the local CLI never replies.** Usually the local `claude` or `codex` CLI is not logged in, or the current session points to a working directory that no longer exists. Send `/status` to inspect; `/new` often fixes it by starting a fresh session.

**The agent subprocess looks frozen (card stuck on the last frame).** Two complementary watchdogs cover this.

- **Tool-stall watchdog (`toolStallTimeoutMinutes`, on by default).** Covers a run wedged on a tool call that never returns — a blocked Bash, an interactive command waiting on stdin, a hung MCP server. Two stages: after 60 minutes of silence the card is annotated with "工具 X 已 60 分钟无输出" and keeps its ⏹ stop button, but **nothing is killed**; only after a further 60 minutes (`toolStallGraceMinutes`) without any event is the run stopped, with the reason shown on the card. A legitimately long tool (OAuth authorization, a slow build) therefore gets a full 2-hour window, and you see the warning before anything dies. The default sits at the top of `runIdleTimeoutMinutes`' range on purpose — a shorter one would quietly become the binding limit and cap a deliberately long idle setting. Any event — including the slow tool finally returning — clears the warning and resets both stages. Set to `0` to disable.
- **Idle watchdog (`runIdleTimeoutMinutes`, off by default).** Kills the run when the agent emits nothing for N minutes. It deliberately **pauses while a tool call is outstanding** so long tools aren't killed mid-work — which is exactly the gap the stall watchdog above fills. Enable with `/config` globally, or `/timeout 10` for the current session; `/timeout off` disables it for the session; `/timeout default` clears the session override.

**A reply never arrived (the card is stuck streaming even though the agent finished).** When a streaming card update fails — an oversized-card 400, a rate limit, a card sequence conflict, a network blip — the bridge re-sends the run's accumulated reply as a plain message prefixed with "⚠️ 消息流式更新失败". Receiving it means the run **did** finish and that message body is the complete result; it may partially repeat what the card already showed.

**The agent says it cannot see an image I sent.** Upgrade to the latest version. Releases before 0.1.0 had a filename-dedup bug.

## Testing and CI

Local checks:

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
```

`pnpm test` includes unit, integration, and process-level adapter tests. CI runs on macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm build`.

## Optional telemetry

By default the bridge reports **nothing**: no metrics, no logs leave your machine, and it pulls in zero telemetry dependencies. The hook below is inert unless you opt in.

To wire up your own monitoring, point an environment variable at a module that default-exports (or exports `createAdapter`) an `AdapterFactory`:

```bash
LARK_CHANNEL_TELEMETRY_MODULE=your-telemetry-package lark-channel-bridge start
```

That module receives every `log.*` event plus error/metric hooks and forwards them wherever you like. The interface is exported from the package root:

```ts
import type { AdapterFactory, TelemetryAdapter, TelemetryEvent } from 'lark-channel-bridge';

const createAdapter: AdapterFactory = (meta) => ({
  emit(event) {/* ship event */},
  recordError(err, ctx) {/* ship exception */},
  recordMetric(name, value, tags) {/* ship metric */},
  flush(timeoutMs) {/* drain buffered events */},
});
export default createAdapter;
```

A missing module, a bad factory, or a throwing adapter all degrade to noop — telemetry can never stop the bridge from starting or break logging.
